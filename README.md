I'm Jamie. Last year I completed a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Reading after gaining a passion for the ever evolving field during A-Levels. During my studies
I covered a wide variety of topics, which culminated in my final year project which was a simulation written in Java to teach users about soil and crop management practices. Following
graduation, I took a year to decide what career path was right for me, as I wanted to use the software development skills but I didn't feel that a full Developer role was the right fit.
During this time, I volunteered with AgeUK, Oxfam, and Crisis at Christmas, as I was eager to learn new skills in different environments and work with others towards a common goal for good.
Once I heard about DevOps and researched what the role entails, it really appealed to me, since it made use of software development skills but didn't require me to create the full implementation
myself. Being a bridge between the Developer and Operation teams sounded very rewarding, and I look forward to putting these skills into practise with Sparta's clients.
